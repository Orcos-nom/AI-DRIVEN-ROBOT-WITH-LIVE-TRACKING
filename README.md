## üö® Problem Statement
### Why Do We Need a Smart Security Rover?
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Warehouses storing hazardous materials like fertilizers and pesticides are prone to security threats.
- **Limitations of Traditional Security:**
  - **CCTV Systems:** Require continuous human monitoring, making them passive and less responsive in real-time scenarios.
  - **Security Guards:** High operational costs and limited ability to cover large areas efficiently.
- **Lack of Automation:** Current security solutions lack automation, increasing the risk of undetected breaches.

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed Solution
The Smart Security Rover aims to overcome these challenges by:
- **Real-Time Surveillance:** Live monitoring of the warehouse environment using an autonomous rover.
- **Automated Threat Detection:** Equipped with AI algorithms to identify potential threats and trigger alerts.
- **Live GPS Tracking:** Provides continuous location updates to ensure situational awareness.
- **Cost-Effective Security:** Reduces dependency on human security guards while maintaining high levels of security.
